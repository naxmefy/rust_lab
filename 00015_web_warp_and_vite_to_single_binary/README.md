Based on https://fdeantoni.medium.com/single-rust-binary-with-vite-svelte-66944f9ac561

## What I do not like here

- the tutorial lacks in information 
  - whole example can only be fullfilled with the [github example](https://github.com/zupzup/rust-frontend-example-yew)
  - missing base infos to wasm (target installation etc.)


## Missing

- testing
